# Debianization for the erlang_ale Library

The repo contains so called DEBIAN directory with
scripts and configs needed to package the
[erlang_ale](https://github.com/esl/erlang_ale)
library into a DEB package for the Debian Jessie distro.

Erlang/ALE provides high level abstractions for interfacing to hardware peripherals through I2C, SPI, and GPIOs on embedded platforms.
